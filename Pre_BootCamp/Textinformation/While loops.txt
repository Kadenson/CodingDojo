while (condition) {    
        // what to keep doing as long as the condition is true

    // we get to this line when the condition in the loop is false

    //example
    var num = 0;    // start a variable at 0
while (num <= 5) {    
    console.log(num);    // print the current value of num    
    num++;       // increment num by 1
}
