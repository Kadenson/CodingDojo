        <h2>When was Ahri born?</h2>
        <p>Ahri was born on march 6, 2018 in Chicago, IL. She was a very quiet child despite there being so much
            pressure on her new parents and made their lives so much easier then it needed to be. She will soon learn 
            that they really appreciated that the most about her because that soon changes when she reaches the age of 3.</p>

        <h2>How was ahris childhood?</h2>
        <p>Ahri was a non problem child. Very attentive, very quiet. She rarely cried or fussed, she hardly made any messes
            unless she was playing with her best friend Dana the Husky. As Ahri grew up and learned to walk and talk things would soon
            get more chaotic for the family because the once quiet baby would now never stop talking as she expanded her vocabulary.</p>

        <h2>How is ahri doing in the present day?</h2>
            <p>Ahri is currently about to turn 4 years old. She attends school every morning like all the other kids and with her expanded
            vocabulary including numbers and sentences of all different kinds of words she has now created the tools she needs to communicate.
            She is learning slowly but thats ok but everyone is different and thats something that she will learn as she continues her life down the
            road. There are a lot of lessons along the way but she isnt alone because she has her dad and mom and of course her best friend Dana the 
            husky.</p>

    <h2>Ahris Best Friend!</h2>
    <p>Ahris best friend is Dana. Shes a husky who is a year older then Ahri. They basically grew up together and continue to be
    the best of friends. These two find their way into all types of trouble but Ahri is quick to throw the blame once they get caught.
    Dana enjoys Ahris company and will always look to her when she feels alone or just when she wants to have fun.</p>
